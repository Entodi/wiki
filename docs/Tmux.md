tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It
allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a
single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line
program at the same time.

[A tmux Crash Course](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/a-tmux-crash-course)

To launch tmux, simply type `tmux` on the terminal.
If you encounter an error, you can add `/usr/bin` to your path, e.g. `export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`, or use an alias, e.g. `alias tmux=/usr/bin/tmux` (run the command or add to your `~/.bashrc`).
