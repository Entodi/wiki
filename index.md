Welcome to the TReNDS cluster documentation. It provides example job
submission scripts and guide to running various applications
interactively on the GSU/TReNDS cluster. This is heavily influenced by
the [Georgia Tech PACE cluster
documentation](https://docs.pace.gatech.edu/).

## New to the cluster?

Before you start, please take a look at this documentation and this page in particular: [Getting Started](docs/Getting_Started)

It may look overwhelming but in fact, the rules are simple:
- Run your jobs ONLY through SLURM
- Experiment and develop on development nodes (we have 2 CPU nodes designated for that and one GPU node)
- NEVER EVER run any computation on the login node ðŸ™‚

The other details are in the documentation. Also, you may want to join our cluster slack channel [#hpc-tips](http://trendscenter.slack.com/#hpc-tips) to ask questions if in trouble.
